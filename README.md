# About Me
## My Interests
- AI/ML (2/17/2025): Something fantasized to me for far too long, I've always had a distant, dormant _dream_ to study artificial intelligence. Althought I have just started, I do not seek primarily to discover how amazing or wonderous they can go. Instead, I find in it an **infinite, impossible** quest to understand the human mind, to learn the ideals of becoming productive, ambitious, humble, and compassionate, and to take action.
- Games (2/17/2025): Games used to be a double-edged sword: an escape from reality that took time off my hands. But over the years, I've come to view them as a source of inspiration. Video games introduced me to characters, qualities, and traits I've learned through sports like basketball and lacrosse that now shape my approach to gaming and creativity.  
 I now see games as a way to tell stories, inspire others, and explore dreams. My goal is to one day create games that motivate and connect people, offering them characters to love, learn from, and aspire to become.
- The Human Mind (2/17/2025): As of now, the brain is not fully understood yet. As I have a passion for immunology/biology, I also wish to learn how the mind works for me, for others, and how it can be developed uniquely for each of us to become the best version of ourselves. If someone asks me a theoretical/applied question on training the mind, I'd probably love to discuss it.

## Sources of Learning
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Please be careful with how you use it! I regularly like to search up podcasts on the mind (Goggins), research, and music videos. **If you'd like, I highly recommend any of these videos for inspiration.**
